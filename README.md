# Gym Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
A structured record of my personal gym journey over three months, detailing each workout day, exercises performed, weights, reps, and additional cardio, core, wrist, and forearm training.  

This project demonstrates:
- Data organization  
- Tracking progress  
- Cleaning and transforming raw inputs  
- Analyzing performance trends  

---

## üõ† Data Collection
- **Type:** Primary data (self-collected and documented)  
- **Period:** The dataset covers a period of a little over 3 months (from April 28, 2025 to August 6, 2025). 
- **Content:** Exercises, sets, reps, weights (kg), RIR (Reps in Reserve), cardio and accessory training.  

---

## üîÑ Data Cleaning (Power Query in Excel)
I used **Power Query (M language)** for cleaning and structuring the dataset.

### Key steps:
1. **Extracting numbers and text**  
   - Original data contained mixed formats (e.g., `4 per hand` in the `kg` and `reps` columns).  
   - Used `Text.Select` to separate numeric values and text into **two temporary columns**.  

2. **Error handling with `try...otherwise`**  
   - Replaced error rows with values from the other column using:
     ```m
     try [kg_set_1_number] otherwise [kg_set_1]
     ```
   - This produced a clean column with numeric values for `kg` and text (`per hand`) stored in the `exercise_name` column.  

3. **Correct data types applied**  
   - `kg` ‚Üí Decimal Number  
   - `reps` ‚Üí Whole Number  
   - `RIR` ‚Üí Whole Number  
   - `exercise_name` ‚Üí Text  

4. **Validation**  
   - Dataset contains many zeros ‚Üí these are intentional (they represent exercises not performed, not missing values).  
   - ‚úÖ No `null` or `NA` values remain.

## Analysis - Questions, Answers, Reasoning, and Insights

### 1. Dataset Timeframe
**My data spans from April 28 to August 6, covering a total of 100 calendar days.**

### 2. Average Trainings per Week
Using the **Real Week** column from our central table, we can see in which weeks of 2025 workouts were performed.  
**On average, I trained 4 times per week.**

### 3. Day of the Week with Most Gym Visits
**Tuesday** was the day with the most sessions, totaling **13 visits (22% of workouts)**, while **Thursday** had the fewest, with **6 sessions (10%)**.  
No workouts were recorded on **Sundays** during this period.

### 4. Training Count by Weekday Plan
The **push routine** was the most frequent, with **24 sessions out of 58 workouts (41%)**.  
This aligns with personal observations, as these muscle groups showed the greatest strength and muscle development.  
*While anecdotal, this illustrates the link between training frequency and muscle development.*

### 5. Muscle Group Count
Across **58 training days**, I worked **10 different muscle groups**, with the greatest focus on **Shoulders (64%)** and the least on **Glutes (9%)**.

### 6. Type of Training After Strength Workouts
- **No additional training (neither cardio nor core/wrist/forearm):** 30 times (**52%**)  
- **Cardio:** 23 times (**40%**)  
- **Core/Wrist/Forearm (CWF):** 5 times (**9%**)  

### 7. Total Training in 3 Months (100 Days)
I trained on **58 of 100 days**, accounting for **58% of the period**.

### 8. Average Weekly Frequency per Muscle Group
Between **weeks 18 and 32 of 2025**, I recorded **58 workouts**.  
- Most muscle groups were trained **once per week**.  
- **Shoulders** and **Triceps** were trained **twice per week**, showing an emphasis on the upper body.  
- Leg muscles (**Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings**) were trained less frequently, highlighting an opportunity for a more balanced plan.  
*Note: Cardio days were entered in all three ‚Äúmuscle group‚Äù columns but counted as only one session per day.*

### 9. Upper vs. Lower Body Training
- **Upper body:** 44 sessions  
- **Lower body:** 12 sessions  
- **Other (full cardio days):** 2 sessions  

### 10. Average Rest Days
The average rest period between workouts was **2 days**.  
While consistency was maintained, some weeks included longer breaks for deeper recovery.  
Overall, most rests were **short (1‚Äì2 days)**, complemented by occasional longer breaks.

### 11. Average Session Volume
Excluding cardio and null entries, the **47 recorded training days** consistently involved **3 muscle groups per session**.  
This reflects a **balanced and consistent approach** to workout planning.

## üìä Next Steps
- Perform analysis of progress and performance trends (weights lifted, reps, RIR).  
- Build visualizations to show improvement over time.  
- Generate actionable insights on training patterns.  

---

- During analysis, I detected 2 typos (‚ÄòCaardio‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòCardio‚Äô in the column muscle_group_1, "Shoulder" instead of "Shoulders" in the column muscle_group_2). The errors were corrected in the cleaning stage to maintain consistency

## üöÄ Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation with **Power Query (M language)**  
- Data typing and error handling (`try...otherwise`)  
- Structuring raw exercise logs into a quantifiable dataset  
- Preparing the foundation for **analysis and visualization**
